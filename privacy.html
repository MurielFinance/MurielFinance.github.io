                The personal information we collect is stored and processed in Canada and United States, or where we or our partners, affiliates and

                <br/><br/>
                We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from
                countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the
                EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using
                standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
                <br/><br/>
                Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to
                another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other
                jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the
                ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party
                engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy
                laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able
                to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
